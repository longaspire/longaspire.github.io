        <h2><a href="http://longaspire.github.io">Huan Li</a>'s Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Here is a brief introduction to my recent research and practice projects.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h4>
            AR-based Mobile Social Application
        </h4>
        <p>2011, <i>The Innovative Experimental Program</i>, Sichuan University</p>
        <p>
            In this project, we designed and implemented an Augmented Reality (AR) browser on Android platform. The
            browser allows users to leave the message and multimedia information through a 3D real-world view. I served
            as the backend and app developer. The program was under the supervision of Associate Prof. Hui Li. The
            application was awarded for the 1st Prize in the Computer Software Contest of Sichuan Province.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Direction-Aware Tourism Information Search Engine
        </h4>
        <p>2012, <i>Undergraduate Graduation Project</i>, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            In this project, I designed and implemented a Java web application that allows users to search the tourism
            information according to the direction preference they specified. The core technique was extended based on a
            research paper [1]. The project was supervised by Prof. Lidan Shou (Zhejiang University) and Associate Prof.
            Xuwei Li (Sichuan University) when I was visiting the Database Laboratory of Zhejiang University.
        </p>

        <h4>
            LBS Music Recommendation System
        </h4>
        <p>2012, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            In this project, we developed an LBS Music Recommendation System named Pictune [2]. I served as the frontend
            developer, and my main task was to implement a cross-platform application with javascript and html5. The
            project was in cooperation with NetEase Inc.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Cyber-Physical Language &amp; Context-aware Message System
        </h4>
        <p>2012-2013, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            During the period, I joined the Cyber-Physical System R&D Group that discusses and develops the ideas of
            Cyber-Physical System, Interest of Things, and Augmented Reality Techniques. We proposed a novel lightweight
            XML-based markup language mechanism [3] allowing for organizing a set of related physical objects. To
            demonstrate the idea, I implemented a context-aware message system that allows users to immensely send and
            receive the message with perceiving the physical world context. The prototype incorporates a hybrid
            positioning module that provides seamless positioning during the cyber-physical web navigation outdoors and
            indoors. This is the first time I got to indoor positioning technologies.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Vision-Enhanced Indoor Positioning Techniques
        </h4>
        <p>2013-2014, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            In this project, my work mainly focused on the design of indoor localization system that can be adapted to
            heterogeneous environments and offer the location-aware services to a wide range of devices. To this end, we
            worked on the analysis of sensor information available on smartphones, such as the readings from the WiFi
            interface, compass and gyroscope and the images from the camera. To make full use of such data that refers
            to the same position, we devised a novel metric learning algorithm to synthesize a joint and more
            informative data feature for inferring the underlying device position and pose. A relevant paper [4] has
            been published on ACM UbiComp'15, one of the topmost academic conference for mobile computing.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Indoor Density and Indoor Flow Analysis Techniques
        </h4>
        <p>2014-2015, Database Group, Aalborg University, Denmark</p>
        <p>
            During the period, I was a visiting researcher (advised by Associate Prof. Hua Lu) in the Center for
            Data-intensive Systems (Daisy) at Aalborg University -- a group led by Prof. C.S. Jensen. My research at
            Daisy focused on the novel density and flow analysis techniques in complicated indoor scenarios. We
            investigated two kinds of data uncertainties that result from indoor positioning, namely the spatial
            uncertainty and temporal uncertainty. Considering the characteristics of indoor space topology and indoor
            moving objects, we devised efficient and effective data structures and algorithms to find the densest or the
            most frequently-visited indoor regions from the uncertain indoor positioning data. Our findings are
            practically useful in human's daily life (e.g., congestion control and public resource management). Two
            relevant papers [5-6] have been submitted to/published on IEEE TKDE, one of the leading journals for
            database and
            data mining.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Toolkit for Indoor Mobility Data Generation
        </h4>
        <p>2015-2016, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            Analytics on users' indoor mobility data has emerged as a promising research frontier. However, the
            community is missing a synthetic data generator that analysts could use to study algorithms assuming
            different indoor positioning technologies. In this project, we designed and implemented a generic,
            user-configurable toolkit for generating different types of indoor mobility data for real-world buildings.
            It can be used to simulate high volumes of indoor mobility data to evaluate location-dependent
            queries/algorithms. It can also provide the additional "ground truth" for effectiveness studies in
            analytics. A relevant paper [7] has been published on VLDB'16 -- one of the best conferences in the database
            field. The detail information of this project can be referred to its website [8].
        </p>

        <h4>
            Literature Repository for Indoor Data Management
        </h4>
        <p>2015-2016, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            A good number of research topics have been recently concentrated on indoor mobility data management (e.g.,
            cleansing, indexing, computation and query processing). In this project, I built a Literature Repository for
            the researchers or practitioners who are interested in such topics to discuss, explore, and inspire their
            thoughts and ideas. A batch of relevant literature was summarized in the form of latex-beamer-style slides.
            Those essential slides and paperwork have been published in the GitHub [9] and GitBook [10] synchronously.
            The ongoing project involves in total 600+ pages PDF, tens of related works from 100+ researchers.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Commercial Indoor Data Analysis and Visualization Platform
        </h4>
        <p>2016-2018, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University</p>
        <p>
            This project explored the idea that rapidly-increasing, massive and heterogeneous indoor positioning data
            can well reflect the behaviors of pedestrians and customers when they are walking in the shopping mall with
            their smartphones. Multiple useful and valuable knowledge can be discovered from those captured behaviors.
            For example, a store owner can know the stop duration, (semantic) trajectory and even personal preference of
            a visitor. It can benefit more from integrating with additional data sources (e.g., the products and sales
            data collected from the stores, the promotion data collected from the mall). The project was in cooperation
            with Tsinghua University and a famous shopping mall in Hangzhou downtown. I served as the project manager.
            Two relevant papers [11-12] have been submitted to VLDB'18.
            The detail information of this project can be referred to its website [13].
