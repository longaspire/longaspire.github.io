Here is a brief introduction to my recent research and development projects.

________________

#### 1. Design and Implementation of AR-based LBS Social Software on Smartphone

2011, *The Innovative Experimental Program*, Sichuan University

This program was under the supervision of Associate Prof. Hui Li, we designed and implemented an android version augmented reality (AR) browser, I worked as the back end and app developer, our application helps users leave message and also multimedia information to each other from a view of 3D real-world. This application was awarded for the 1st Prize in the Computer Software Contest of Sichuan Province.

#### 2. Design of Direction-Aware Tourism Information Search Engine

2012, *Undergraduate Graduation Design*, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

This work was supervised by Prof. Lidan Shou (Zhejiang University) and Associate Prof. Xuwei Li (Sichuan University) when I was visiting the Database Laboratory of Zhejiang University, it's a Java web application for searching tourism information by the input of direction. I improved the query processing algorithm in a research paper [4] to support our application.

#### 3. LBS Music Recommendation System

2012, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

In this project, we aimed at developing a LBS Music Recommendation System named "Pictune" on the basis of a published research paper [1] in our laboratory. This project is in cooperation with NetEase Inc. I worked as a front-end developer. To make a cross-platform production, we used javascript and html5 to create apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone respectively.

#### 4. Cyber-Physical Language & Context-aware Message System

2012-2013, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

In this year, I took participation in the Cyber-Physical System R&D Group. In this group, we investigated and discussed the ongoing ideas for developing the conception of Cyber-Physical and also the implementation of Augmented Reality techniques.

During the period, our group published a work [2] that proposed a novel lightweight XML-based markup language mechanism allowing for organizing a set of related physical objects. To better demonstrate our idea, I undertook the work to build a prototype of context-aware message system for users to immensely send and receive message with perceiving the physical world context. It is worth noting that a hybrid positioning module was also implemented in this prototype to provide seamless positioning during the navigation of cyber-physical web from outdoor space to indoor environment or vice versa, and that is the first time I got to indoor positioning.

#### 5. Vision-Enhanced Indoor Positioning Techniques

2013-2014, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

In this work, my research mainly focused on the design of location-based systems for indoors. The main aim is to design a generic and extensible architecture, able to be adapted to heterogeneous environments and able to offer different location-based services to a wide range of devices.

We worked on the analysis of sensors available on smartphones, since these are the source of information that we need in order to obtain context information useful to identify the place where users are moving around and hence to infer their positions.

In that sense, we analyse the information extracted from WiFi interface, camera and gyroscope. As the synthetic features extracted from multiple sensors cannot directly be used for specific issues, we invent novel metric learning algorithms in order to bridge their gaps for practical applications. Our work [3] has been published in the ACM UbiComp'15, one of the topmost international academic conference in computer science.

#### 6. Novel Dense-aware Query Processing Techniques in Indoor Enviroments

2014-2015, Database Group, Aalborg University, Denmark

During this period, I worked as a visiting researcher (advised by Associate Prof. Hua Lu) in the Center for Data-intensive Systems (Daisy), a group headed by Prof. C. S. Jensen.

My research in Daisy (Aalborg University) was focused on the novel data management and query processing techniques in complicated indoor environments. We studied on two interesting positioning data uncertainties caused by indoor positioning systems, namely the spatial uncertainty and temporal uncertainty. Combined with the characteristic of indoor moving objects, we designed efficient and effective query processing algorithms to address various different problems which are practically useful in people's daily life (e.g., congestion control and security management).

#### 7. Toolkit for Generating Indoor Mobility Data

2015-2016, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

With the proliferation of indoor positioning systems, analytics on users' indoor mobility data has emerged as a promising research frontier. However, the database community is missing a synthetic data generator that analysts could use to study algorithms assuming different indoor positioning technologies. Such a generator can be used to simulate high volumes of indoor mobility data to evaluate location-dependent queries/algorithms, it can also provide the additional "ground truth" for the synthetic mobility data generated in spite of the discrete nature of the simulated data, which is useful for effectiveness studies in analytics.

We design and implement a generic, user-configurable toolkit for generating different types of indoor mobility data for real-world buildings, the related paper [5] has recently been accepted by VLDB'16 -- one of the best academic conferences in database field. The detail information of this project can be referred to its web site [6].

#### 8. Literature Repository for Indoor Data Management

2015-2016, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

Recently, an increasing number of researches have been conduct on the management of indoor-space mobility data. In the year 2015, I start to build a so-called Literature Repository for the researchers or practitioners who are interested in such topics to discuss, to explore, to inspire their thoughts and ideas. A batch of classic literatures in the relevant fields are selected and surveyed in the form of latex-beamer-style slides.

Those essential slides and paperworks have been recently published in the GitHub [7] and GitBook [8] synchronously in a open-source style. This ongoing project involves in total 600+ pages PDF, tens of related works from 100+ researchers. In the future, we plan to make it the best place for the indoor big-data fans to learn and to gain.

#### 9. Commercial Indoor Data Analysis Platform for Large Shopping Malls

2015-2016, Database Laboratory, Zhejiang University

I took charge of the manager in this project, it explored the idea that rapidly-increasing, massive and heterogeneous indoor mobility data can well reflect the behaviors of pedestrians and customers when they hold the mobile devices and walk inside the intelligent sensor-enhanced indoor environments, like a large-scale shopping mall. This project is in cooperation with Tsinghua University and a famous high-end shopping mall in Hangzhou downtown.

Multiple useful and valuable knowledge can be discovered from those captured behaviors, e.g., a business owner of a shop can know the stop duration, (semantic) trajectory and even personal preference of a visitor. It can even benefit more from integrating with other heterogeneous data sources, e.g. the products and sales data collected from the shops, the promotion information collected from the mall, etc.
